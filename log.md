# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Did a course on CSS Grid which I'll use tomorrow on developing a website.

**Thoughts**: CSS Grid is Amazing. I love how it works and how easy it is to create flexible layouts with it.

### Day 2: January 8, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished yesterday's CSS Grid course and started developing the website I mentioned previously. I'll use React, Redux for it.

**Thoughts**: I really like CSS Grid, but I still haven't fully understood how it works. I have to keep using it for distinct layouts to be able to master it.
