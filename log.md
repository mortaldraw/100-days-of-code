# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Did a course on CSS Grid which I'll use tomorrow on developing a website.

**Thoughts**: CSS Grid is Amazing. I love how it works and how easy it is to create flexible layouts with it.

### Day 2: January 8, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished yesterday's CSS Grid course and started developing the website I mentioned previously. I'll use React, Redux for it.

**Thoughts**: I really like CSS Grid, but I still haven't fully understood how it works. I have to keep using it for distinct layouts to be able to master it.

### Day 3: January 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished setting up the three distinct layouts which I'll be using on my website. Also did a small mockup of the interactive calendar.

**Thoughts**: I'm starting to understand the power of mixing Flexbox and Grid displays. They are pretty fun and easy to use once you grasp the concept of how they work.
